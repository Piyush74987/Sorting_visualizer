# Sorting Visualizer

Your project, Sorting_visualizer, is a web application designed to provide a visual representation of classic sorting algorithms. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to see how different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort work in real-time.

# Key Features:
## Interactive Visualization:
Users can watch how each sorting algorithm processes an array of numbers step by step.

## Algorithm Selection:
The application lets users choose between various sorting algorithms to see how each one performs.

## Custom Input:
Users may be able to input their own arrays or generate random arrays to see how the algorithms handle different data sets.

## Speed Control: 
The speed of the visualization can be adjusted, allowing users to slow down or speed up the sorting process to better understand each step.


This application supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**.
2. **Insertion Sort**.
3. **Selection Sort**.
4. **Merge Sort**.
5. **Quick Sort**.

This project is a great way to help learners and developers understand how these fundamental algorithms operate under the hood.
